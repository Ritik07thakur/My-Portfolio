# **App Name**: Starlight Folio

## Core Features:

- Interactive Starfield: Animated galaxy background rendered using Canvas API or Three.js, featuring twinkling stars, nebula swirls, and shooting stars. The starfield subtly reacts to cursor movements and scrolling, simulating depth and parallax.
- Responsive Navigation: Navigation bar that collapses to a hamburger menu on small screens
- Frosted Content Cards: Glassmorphism-style cards provide a backdrop for text without obscuring the background elements. These containers will neatly hold information for the about, skills, projects and contact sections.
- Fade-In Animations: Include smooth fade-in effects on scroll for all content sections using Framer Motion

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to suggest refinement. The chosen color looks striking against the night sky, providing readability.
- Background color: Near black (#0A0A0A), evoking deep space. The low saturation helps convey the feeling of distance and space, in combination with brightness that makes the background dark but not crushing.
- Accent color: Pale rose (#FFB6C1), used sparingly for interactive elements. Being about 30 degrees to the "left" of the soft lavender on the color wheel, this rose color works well. It has a palpably different saturation and brightness, creating the needed contrast.
- Clean, sans-serif font for code snippets to maintain readability and align with the modern aesthetic.
- Content is divided into clear sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact) placed on frosted glass cards.
- Subtle animations on scroll, like content fading in or parallax effects, for a dynamic feel.
